# zFactor.DL

The goal of zFactor.DL is to create a correlation using neural networks.

## Dataset
The tidy dataset contains `r dim(narrow_dataset)[1]` observations of compressibility factor at different Pseudo-reduced Temperature and Pseudo-reduced pressures. These observations have been taken from a digital scan of the 1942 Standing-Katz chart for hydrocarbon gases.
